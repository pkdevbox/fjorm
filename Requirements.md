fjorm is supposed to work on whatever you can run Java onto.

It has following external dependencies:
  * [Apache Commons Pool](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-pool/), [download v1.6 here](http://www.poolsaboveground.com/apache//commons/pool/binaries/commons-pool-1.6-bin.zip)
  * [Apache Commons DBCP](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/), [download v1.4 here](http://www.gtlib.gatech.edu/pub/apache//commons/dbcp/binaries/commons-dbcp-1.4-bin.zip)

You'll need to use JAR file of your database driver. Fjorm is supposed to work with any database and it has been initially developed using MySQL. You can find a [MySQL driver here](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).
