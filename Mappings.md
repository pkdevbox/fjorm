# Mappings #

fjorm do not support automatic generation of mappings. Why? Because we didn't need it. Creating manually Class objects from 'create table' statement usually requires around 1 minute manually and for application with less than 60 tables it is possible to do it in 1 hour. If doing automatic creation, you'd have to set it up and to check if it is done correctly. It might take you approximately same amount of time. That's why with fjorm you have to do it manually.

To map the class to the database use annotation 'TableName', i.e.

```
 @TableName(table = "image_vote")
```

If the field is `Id` annotate it as well, if the field uses the key generated from the database annotate it with `AutoGenerated`, i.e.
```
  @Id
  @AutoGenerated
  public int id;
```


If two or more fields are composite key for the table, specify it with `CompositeKey` annotation, i.e.
```
  @CompositeKey
  public String title;

  @CompositeKey
  public String subtitle;
```

If you want to have a public field in your Class which is not persisted in the database annodate it with `Transient`, i.e. from ImageInfo example
```
  @Transient
  public double distance_meters;
```

## Remember ##

1. fjorm requires you to use the same field name in the database as in java. **This is done to prevent confusion**. Name fields clear in the database and then fjorm will use that clear name as well. Less confusion.
